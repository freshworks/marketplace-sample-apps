# CTI Sample App

This app showcases a use-case of setting up a call center solution with the use of [Twilio](https://www.twilio.com/voice) on Freshdesk.

## Functionality

- The app is integrated with Twilio platform to make phone calls to provide call center solution for Freshdesk.
- When the call is made from the app by a support agent, a call will be made to the configured Twilio phone number and then to the actual customer phone number and finally both the parties will be connected.
- Call events are listened by a custom middleware server and update the call status in the app frontend through web socket (socket.io) connection.

- Incoming calls are received by the Twilio number and a webhook from the middleware is triggered by Twilio to notify the incoming call. Meanwhile the call will be received by the support agent.
- The incoming call will be connected with both the parties when the call is connected similar to the outgoing call.
