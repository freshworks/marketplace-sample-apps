## Tickets Close Interceptor App

The Time-tracking feature in Freshdesk lets you track the time spent supporting customers by each agent, thereby giving you a deeper visibility on your overall helpdesk performance. This app intercepts the ticket close event and checks if there is any timer running. If so, it rejects the close action and displays an error message.
