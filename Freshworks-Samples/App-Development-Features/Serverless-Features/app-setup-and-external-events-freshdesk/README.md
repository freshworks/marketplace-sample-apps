## App Setup and External Events (ft. Freshdesk)

This sample code demonstrates how webhooks can be handled on the Freshworks Developer Platform on top of External Events.

### Description

Observing External Events happening outside of your app will enable your app to act by registering a handler JS function. This Handler will be invoked every time the desired event is observed in 3rd party systems

| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| App Setup Events      | Invoke JS function handlers `onAppInstall` and `onAppUninstall`                                     |
| External Events       | Invoke handler JS function when desired event happens with 3rd party system using `onExternalEvent` |

### Prerequisites

1. Make sure you have a trial Freshdesk account created. You can always [sign up](https://freshdesk.com/signup)
2. Ensure that you have the [Freshworks CLI](https://community.developers.freshworks.com/t/what-are-the-prerequisites-to-install-the-freshworks-cli/234) installed properly.
3. App uses pipedream's [event sources features](https://pipedream.com/docs/event-sources/#how-do-event-sources-work) to mock an endpoint to respond with `{"success":"true"}` response. See `thirdPartyEndpoint` in `server.js`.
4. Ensure that the pipedream endpoint is altered accordingly in `server.js`. (Replace `<CHANGE_THIS>` to your pipedrive subdomain)

### Procedure to run the app:

```sh
# Run the app
> fdk run
# app runs on localhost:10001 and simulation page is on http://localhost:10001/web/test
```

### Notes

> Disclaimer: The use of mock servers in production environment is disallowed. pipedream.net can be used to debug or test your app's behavior locally. However, this will not work when the app is deployed in a live account. We recommend switching to a custom mock server controlled by you in such scenarios.
