# Advanced Data Storage App

### Description:

This app allows you to set aliases for links similar to URL shortner services such as bit.ly.
The links can be fetched with the set alias. But, it is stored only for a day time in the data storage just like Instagram story and WhatsApp status. ;)
This app can be used to share a secret with peer support agents without actually sending the link but the alias of the link.
