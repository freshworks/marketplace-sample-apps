### Additional Comments (if any)

```sh
# Run the app
> fdk run
# app runs on localhost:10001 and sample config page is rendered on /custom_configs
```

### Additional Comments (if any)

Freshworks CLI currently doesn't support ES6 javascript considering lots of businesses not using latest browser versions. This app uses ES6 so following lint error is seen.

```sh
❯ fdk validate
Validation failed due to the following issue(s):
[ERROR] app/scripts/app.js::7: Parsing error: Unexpected token function

> fdk pack
# this validates first. hence .zip file is not generated
```

✅ Feedback to support Async/Await is received. Please [upvote](https://community.developers.freshworks.com/t/async-await-not-supported-in-fdk/150/3) to get it prioritised.
