### Additional Comments (if any)

**Apps render without UI**

1. There are couple of app placeholders where app run in background and not backend.
2. These placeholders generally have _background_ in their name. For example, `ticket_background`,`new_ticket_background`, `change_background`,`new_change_background`.
3. Apps those render without UI will load _scripts_ as soon as user navigates to relavant page in Freshservice. For example, the browser's js thread of execution will enter `.js` files in `ticket_background` when user navigates to _Ticket details page on Freshservice_
