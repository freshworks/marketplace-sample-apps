## Freshteam Newhire-Onboarding-Invites

This app assumes the host Freshworks product to be Freshteam, an employee engagement software.

The app observes if new hire has been added and does the following operations:

1. Sends a welcome email to the new hire's official email address.
2. Creates an AWS account and adds new hire to the AWS Organisation.
3. Sends an invite to a configured BitBucket Repository.

The app can be configured to perform any of the 3 operations for each department. This can be done during the installation of the app, and also can be changed later.
