### Additional Comments

Checkout the [Freshdesk SDK documentation](https://developer.freshworks.com/freshdesk-sdk) to see the other available methods to try them out and utilise them instead of approaching the Freshdesk API in the Freshworks apps.

This app can be run from Glitch [here](https://glitch.com/~freshdesk-sdk-demo) by remixing and connecting it with your local system with [FWGL CLI](https://www.npmjs.com/package/fwgl) to see the app in action in your Freshdesk account similar to locally run application. :wink:
