# Voucher code generator for Freshdesk

## Description

A sample app for Freshdesk which helps the agent to generate voucher codes for specific customers.

### TL;DR.

Support Reps will need to check in a different system to get a coupon code for a customer. Most of the inconvenience is logging into a different tool, generating a coupon code, and copy-pasting in the email, and then sending it, with this we don't do that anymore.

#### Soft specs

- App generates voucher code by making an [SMI](https://developers.freshdesk.com/v2/docs/server-method-invocation/) call to a `generateVoucher(){..}` and render coupon code to app's UI.
- On a click of `Paste in Editor` button, automatically paste the coupon code at the open reply's current cursor position.
- Whenever needed app can show recent 5 coupon details generated in the UI.
- Too many vouchers stored?, on Click `Remove History` deletes the voucher code data.
