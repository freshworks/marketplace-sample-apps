Sample Apps in this repository demonstrate features of our developer platform. Any app that you build will be run as part of the in-product experience. Join us in crafting those experiences.

The App development for any Freshworks product follows a common pattern. <mark> Which implies once an app built for one product will be similar to another with very few changes required</mark>.
